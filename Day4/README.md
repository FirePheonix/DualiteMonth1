# Prompts

# Prompt1:
    Create a luxury furniture brand landing page. The brand is called “NoirNova.”

    Hero Section:
    
    - Fullscreen background video (user-supplied) showing a rotating 3D black hole with elegant black, deep blue, and glowing white tones. - Overlay a subtle dark gradient or transparent black layer to improve text contrast. - Centered serif brand name in white: “NoirNova” - Subheadline below: “Where Luxury Meets the Cosmos” - Primary button: “Explore Collection” (scrolls to product section) - Secondary button: “Watch Our Story” (opens modal with brand video) - Smooth fade-in animations for text and buttons.
    Global Styling:
    
    - Entire landing page background: **pure black** (`#000000`) - Color palette: Black, midnight blue (accents), white, optional hints of silver. - All sections must contrast with the pitch black background using white or very subtle blue/gray tones. - Design must remain minimalist, premium, and futuristic.
    Sections to include:
    
    1. **Our Philosophy** – cosmic-inspired minimal copy in large white serif font. 2. **Featured Collection** – 3-4 luxury furniture items, cards with soft glow or light border on black. 3. **Materials & Craftsmanship** – split layout with high-contrast imagery and space-themed terms (e.g., “Meteor Steel,” “Void Velvet”). 4. **Testimonials** – elegant white italic quotes on black with a faint cosmic animation in the background. 5. **Newsletter Signup** – input box with white border and text: “Stay Aligned with the Universe” 6. **Footer** – minimal, all-white text with sleek nav links and cosmic-style social icons.
    Fonts:
    
    - Heading: Playfair Display or Cormorant Garamond (white) - Body: Inter or Lato (light gray or soft white)
    Animations:
    
    - Smooth scroll - Fade-in on scroll - Subtle glowing effects (white/blue) on buttons and borders
    Must feel cinematic, immersive, and luxurious. Do not use any color other than white, deep blue, or silver against the black background.
    
    Insert the following video as background of the hero section:
    
# Prompt2: 
    - Top navbar with brand name “NoirNova” centered or left-aligned, and links: "Collection", "Craftsmanship", "About", "Contact". Right-aligned button: “Buy Now” - Main heading (left-aligned, white, large font): “Experience the Cosmos” - Subheading below in lighter gray: “Furniture That Transcends Space & Time” - Fine print tagline below in small white text: “Each piece is a portal. Handcrafted. Celestial. Limitless.” - Right-aligned paragraph in white (smaller font), describing the luxury experience: “NoirNova blends space-inspired aesthetics with artisanal furniture design. Discover timeless elegance drawn from the universe itself — immersive, bold, and rare.”
    Styling Notes:
    
    - All text in white or soft gray for contrast against the dark background - Elegant serif for headings (e.g., Playfair Display), clean sans-serif for body - Slight transparent dark overlay above video for text clarity - Smooth fade-in animations for headings and text - Must feel cinematic, premium, and mysterious
    Do not change the user-supplied video background.
